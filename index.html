                  Commercial enterprise means any for-profit activity

                  _   A sole proprietorship; </br> </br>

                     An EB-5 investor must invest the required amount of capital in a new
                     commercial enterprise which will create a full-time position for at least 10 qualified employees.   </br> </br>
                      For a new commercial enterprise not located within a regional center, the new commercial enterprise must directly create the full-time positions to be counted. </br> </br>

_    For a new commercial enterprise located within a regional center, the new commercial enterprise can directly or indirectly create the full-time positions. </br> </br>

_    Direct jobs establish an employer-employee relationship between the new commercial enterprise and the persons it employs. </br> </br>

_    Indirect jobs are held outside of the new commercial enterprise but are created as a result of the new commercial enterprise. </br> </br>

_    In the case of a troubled business, the EB-5 investor may rely on job maintenance. </br> </br>

_   The investor must show that the number of existing employees is, or will be, no less than the pre-investment level for a period of at least two years.

                  etc. Any professional level job requires you to have a bachelor’s degree or higher. If you do not 
                  have a bachelor’s degree or higher you may be able to show degree equivalence through work experience 
                  and/or other qualifications.  </br> </br>
                  
                  However, because of the visa cap it is unlikely that an H-1B visa petition will be successful. The US employer petitions for the H-1B Visa in the US which has a duration of up to 6 years. </br> </br>
                  Applying for a non-immigrant visa is generally quicker than applying for a US Green Card, therefore the H-1B visa is popular for companies wishing to bring in staff for long-term assignment in the US.   </br>
                  </br>
                  Please note that individuals cannot apply directly for an H-1B visa. Instead the employer must petition for entry of the employee. </br>
                  </br>
                  Eligibility: specialty occupation </br> </br>
                  
                  The US H1-B visa is designed to be used for staff in specialty occupations. The job must meet one of the following criteria to qualify as a specialty occupation: </br> </br>
                 _    Have a minimum entry requirement of a Bachelor’s or higher degree or its equivalent. </br> </br>

                _    The degree requirement for the job is common to the industry or the job is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree. </br> </br>
                
                _    The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position.  </br> </br>
                
                _    The nature of the specific duties is so specialized and complex that the knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree. </br> </br>
                  
                  Length of stay </br> </br>
                  
                  The H-1B visa is initially granted for up to three years, but may then be extended to a maximum of six years. </br> </br>
                  Even though the H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa, it is one of the few US visa categories recognized as dual intent, meaning the H-1B visa holder can apply for and obtain a US Green Card while in the US on an H-1B visa. If you are still in the US on an H-1B visa and wish to remain in the US for more than six years, you can apply for permanent residency in the US to receive a Green Card. If you do not gain permanent residency prior to the expiration of your H-1B visa, then you must live outside the US for at least one year before reapplying for another H or L visa.

                  When deciding to file a petition for an E-2 work visa, it’s important to be aware of the key E-2 visa requirements for investors and individual guidelines. USCIS saysan E-2 investment as “the investor’s placing of capital, including funds and other assets, at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. Your investment may be to establish a new business venture, or purchase a pre-existing business.” </br> </br>

An E-2 treaty investor visa is a non-immigrant visa reserved for foreign entrepreneurs of countries that have a Treaty of Trade and Commerce with the United States. E-2 investor visa allows foreign investors to enter and work inside of the United States based on a substantial investment in a bona fide enterprise. In this article, we’re going to explain the top E-2 Visa Requirements for Investors and the qualifications.  </br> </br>

There are 2 types of investor visas so before looking into E-2 visa requirements for investors you want to make sure the E-2 visa is the right fit for you as a foreign investor. If the E-2 visa isn’t the correct fit for you, there is also the option of an EB-5 Investor V </br> </br>

On an E-2 visa, you may: </br> </br>

Work legally in the company that is the investment vehicle in the U.S. </br> </br>
Travel freely in and out of the U.S. </br> </br>
Stay on a prolonged basis with unlimited two-year extensions as long as you maintain E-2 qualifications </br> </br>
Be accompanied by your under 21 dependants, relatives and spouse. Your spouse may also work while in the U.S. while your dependents may attend U.S. schools, colleges, and universities, and do not have to apply for a separate student visa. </br> </br>

                  What is a green card? </br> </br>

A green card allows a non-U.S. citizen to gain permanent residence in the United States. Many people from outside the United States want a green card because it would allow them to live and work (lawfully) anywhere in the United States and qualify for U.S. citizenship after three or five years. </br> </br>

Every year, the U.S. government issues more than a million green cards. Most are given to family members of U.S. citizens and current green card holders, followed by workers from other countries seeking employment in the United States as the next biggest group of recipients. </br> </br>

Boundless can help spouses of U.S. citizens with their marriage-based green card application. We turn all the required government forms into simple questions you can answer online — typically in under two hours. </br> </br>

Types of Green Cards </br> </br>

There are many categories of green cards. The most common types are: </br> </br>

Family-Based Green Card </br>
Employment-Based Green Card </br>
Humanitarian Green Cards </br>
Diversity Lottery Green Card </br>

                  Family-Based Immigration </br> </br>

A foreign citizen seeking to live permanently in the United States requires an immigrant visa (IV). To be eligible to apply for an IV, a foreign citizen must be sponsored by an immediate relative who is at least 21 years of age and is either a U.S. citizen or U.S. Lawful Permanent Resident (that is, a green-card holder). </br> </br>

There are two types of family-based immigrant visas: </br> </br>

Immediate Relative – these visas are based on a close family relationship with a U.S. citizen, such as a spouse, child, or parent. The number of immigrants in these categories is not limited to each fiscal year. </br> </br>

Family Preference – these visas are for specific, more distant, family relationships with a U.S. citizen and some specified relationships with a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). The number of immigrants in these categories is limited each fiscal year.  </br> </br>

Keep in mind that U.S. citizens can file an immigrant visa petition for their: </br> </br>

• Spouse </br> </br>

 • Son or daughter </br> </br>

 • Parent </br> </br>

 • Brother or sister </br> </br>

U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents can only file an immigrant visa petition for their: </br> </br>

• Spouse </br> </br>

 • Unmarried son or daughter

Individuals who wish to work in the United States either by investing or starting a business may be eligible for an E-1 or E-2 investor visa, or an L-1 business expansion visa. While most of the countries are not eligible or do not fall under this category, business owners and investors may meet the criteria. Employees as well as their spouse and dependents may also be able to stay in the United States with this visa. </br></br>

How much money do I need to invest for E2 Visa? </br></br>

There is no minimum amount of investment visa. The investment just need to substantial. This means that the substantial amount will depend on factors such as the type of business involved, the number of jobs created by the investor’s personal assets, etc. In most cases, the investment should be at least $100,000USD, but sometimes it may be less than this.

                  The USA is a dreamland and people from around the world want to live the American dream. For living the American dream, one needs to be a lawful permanent resident. The Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) are also known as green cardholders. </br></br>

The green card holders are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to permanently live in the United States of America. Along with this, they may accept an offer of employment without special restrictions, own property, receive financial assistance at public colleges and universities, and join the Armed Forces. If they can meet a certain set of eligibility then can become the U.S. citizen as well.  </br></br>

If you want the acquiring of permanent residency to go smoothly then you need to hire the best immigration lawyer. With 30 years of combined experience, the lawyers at the Trip Law will help you in every step of obtaining permanent residency in the United States of America.

When a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in where the victim induced to perform a sex act is less than 18 years of age; or The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. </br></br>

Note that evidence “force, fraud, and coercion” being present are not required in sex trafficking when the victim is less than 18 years of age.2 </br></br>

In addition to the specifically enumerated types of trafficking, INA § 101(a) (15) (T) (i) (II) requires that the trafficked person is physically present in the United States on account of the trafficking. The same section includes persons who are allowed entry into the United States for their participation in the investigation or prosecution of an act of trafficking in the definition of “physically present in the United States on account of trafficking.”

                  The U visa is a non-immigrant visa that is reserved for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials with regards to investigating and prosecuting criminal activity.  The U visa offers individuals a road to temporary, and in some cases, permanent U.S. residence. </br></br>

The U non-immigrant visa category was created by Congress in 2000 with the intent to strengthen the ability of law enforcement and government officials to investigate and prosecute criminal activity, such as trafficking, fraud, domestic violence, witness tampering, false imprisonment, blackmail, involuntary servitude, and more. The idea was to help law enforcement agencies and offer protection to victims of such crimes at the same time. </br></br>

An individual is eligible for a U non-immigrant visa if he or she can demonstrate that: </br></br>

The individual is the victim of criminal activity that qualifies for purposes of the U visa; </br>
The individual has suffered significant physical or mental abuse as a consequence of the criminal activity; </br>
The individual has information about the criminal activity; </br>
The individual was helpful, is currently helpful, or is likely to be helpful to law enforcement officials with the investigation and prosecution of the crime; </br>
The crime in question has taken place in the U.S. or in contravention of U.S. laws; and </br>
The individual is otherwise admissible to the United States. </br>
Simply filling out the appropriate forms is not enough when an individual is applying for a U visa. Instead, the applicant must gather paperwork and documents that support a claim of injury. This typically includes a personal narrative statement describing the situation and providing context about the crime. The applicant should also provide evidence that he or she is a victim of qualifying criminal activity. In most instances, applicants will gather relevant medical records, affidavits from social workers and medical personnel, police reports, court documents, orders of protection, and affidavits from individuals who have personal knowledge about the crime. </br> </br>

A U visa holder can bring his or her immediate family members to the United States. However, the principal U visa petitioner must have his or her own visa approved before family members can be eligible for their own derivative U visas. If the principal petitioner is under 21 years of age, that person may petition on behalf of his or her spouse, children, parents, and unmarried siblings under the age of 18. If the principal is over 21, that person may petition on behalf of his or her spouse and children. In order to petition for a qualified family member, the petitioner must file Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Receipt. If an individual is applying for a U visa from within the United States, he or she will most likely not be required to have an interview at a local USCIS office. However, if the person is applying from outside the U.S., he or she will likely have an interview at a U.S. embassy or U.S. consulate in his or her home country. If the interview with the U.S. official goes well, the applicant’s U visa will be approved.

              <p>
                  Refugee status determination is normally a governmental procedure. Each government decides according to its established national procedures to whom to grant refugee status among asylum applicants. Asylum and refugee status are special legal protections available to people who have left their home country for their own safety and are afraid to return to any place within that country.  </br></br>

Asylum is a protection granted to foreign nationals already in the United States or arriving at the border who meet the international law definition of a “refugee.” The United Nations 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol define a refugee as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country, and cannot obtain protection in that country, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of being persecuted in the future “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” Congress incorporated this definition into U.S. immigration law in the Refugee Act of 1980. </br></br>

As a signatory to the 1967 Protocol, and through U.S. immigration law, the United States has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as refugees. The Refugee Act established two paths to obtain refugee status—either from abroad as a resettled refugee or in the United States as an asylum seeker. If you need political asylum and refugee status, you can contact Trip Law firm. Wei will help you to manage the issue and take care of it in no time.

                  Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a program that offers a temporary legal status to certain immigrants in the United States who cannot return to their country of origin due to ongoing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary reasons. </br></br>

Once the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issues a TPS designation for nationals from such a country, applicants must prove they have continuously lived in the United States since a specific date and undergo a criminal and security background check. </br></br>

The secretary of Homeland Security can grant and renew TPS for periods of six to 18 months. At this point, TPS beneficiaries must apply for renewal, submit to additional background checks, and pay a fee.

                  Understanding How Criminal Defense and Immigration Law Intersect </br></br>

When the citizen of the United States is convicted of a crime, they can face probation, fines, jail time and other penalties. When the noncitizen is found guilty of the offense, their status, as well as future in the country, are immediately put into jeopardy. The intersection between criminal law and immigration is called crimmigration. This is a legal concept that has grown more prominent in recent years. </br></br>

Historically, the following offenses are considered crimes of moral turpitude: </br></br>

· Murder </br></br>

· Rape </br></br>

· Spousal abuse </br></br>

· Child abuse </br></br>

· Robbery or theft </br></br>

· Kidnapping </br></br>

· Aggravated assault </br></br>

In most situations, the noncitizen faces a criminal charge that can lead to removal and deportation. Even the removal is avoided, having the criminal recond can endanger the current as well as future immigration efforts, including the citizenship application and even lawful permanent residency.  </br></br>

In such a case, you do not only need an experienced lawyer but a dependable one. At Trip Law, we will tactfully handle your case to avoid any future issues regarding your immigration and citizenship.

        Adjustment of status is the process of changing from a nonimmigrant immigration status such as tourist, student etc. to permanent residency. If the U.S. immigration law allows a temporary visitor to change the status to a permanent resident then the individual needs to meet certain requirements. It might take 8 to 12 months to adjust the status.
